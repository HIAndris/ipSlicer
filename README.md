# HIAndris's ipSlicer - How to use

## 1.

### On Windows
- Download the .exe file from the builds folder matching your system
- Now you can run the program with a cmd to be able to see the output lines
### On Linux
- If you are on linux, you are probably competent enough to compile a C++ file and run it

## 2.
- Type in the IPv4 address you want to "slice up" to make subnets
- Then the mask
- Then the number of hosts you want to have in each subnet

## 3.
- If you have done everything correctly, you should see the addresses assigned to each subnet with the index of the subnet
